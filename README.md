# Color Explorer

This is an app for exploring colors, built for fun. It's an exercise to learn
web development fundamentals, using the simplest technology stack: plain HTML,
CSS, & client-side JS.

## Exercise Constraints
- No libraries, frameworks, templates, or preprocessors
- No server side processing (e.g. Node or Deno)
- No dev tools except Git, an editor, and a web browser

## Goals
- [x] Show all of the [CSS color names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors).
- [x] Show all 4096 shorthand color codes (e.g. "#639").
- [x] Show white or black text depending on the color's [brightness (a.k.a. luma)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luma_%28video%29).
- [x] Filter color names & codes, given a substring (e.g. "blue" or "0f").
